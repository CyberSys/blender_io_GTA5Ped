# blender_io_GTA5Ped
import-export of parts of OpenIV's openFormats, focused on ped meshes.

Currently, it can import skeletons (wrongly positioned) and meshes, and can export meshes.

Materials aren't supported (no import nor export), and it does not look for textures (meshes are imported with UVs though).

Import-export buttons are found at the "File" menu.
